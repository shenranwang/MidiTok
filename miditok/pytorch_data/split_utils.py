    Split a list of music files into smaller chunks to use for training.

    Splitting files allows to split them into chunks of lengths calculated in function
    of the note densities of its bars in order to reduce the padding of the batches,
    using the :py:func:`miditok.pytorch_data.split_score_per_note_density` method.
    The files are only split at bars, in order have chunks starting at relevant times.

    File splitting can be performed on a dataset once. This method will save a hidden
    file, with a name corresponding to the hash of the list of file paths, in the
    ``save_dir`` directory. When called, it will first check that this file does not
    already exist, and if it is the case will return the paths to all the files within
    ``save_dir``.

    **If your tokenizer does not tokenize all tracks in one sequence of tokens**
    (``tokenizer.one_token_stream``), the music tracks will be split independently.

    :param files_paths: paths to music files to split.
    :param tokenizer: tokenizer.
    :param save_dir: path to the directory to save the files splits.
    :param max_seq_len: maximum token sequence length that the model will be trained
        with.
    :param average_num_tokens_per_note: average number of tokens per note associated to
        this tokenizer. If given ``None``, this value will automatically be calculated
        from the first 200 files with the
        :py:func:`miditok.pytorch_data.get_average_num_tokens_per_note` method.
    :param num_overlap_bars: will create chunks with consecutive overlapping bars. For
        example, if this argument is given ``1``, two consecutive chunks might end at
        the bar *n* and start at the bar *n-1* respectively, thus they will encompass
        the same bar. This allows to create a causality chain between chunks. This value
        should be determined based on the ``average_num_tokens_per_note`` value of the
        tokenizer and the ``max_seq_len`` value, so that it is neither too high nor too
        low. (default: ``1``).
    :param min_seq_len: minimum sequence length, only used when splitting at the last
        bar of the file. (default: ``None``, see default value of
        :py:func:`miditok.pytorch_data.split_score_per_note_density`)

    Split a ``symusic.Score`` (at bars) into chunks depending on their note densities.

    This method aims to split music files at bars to reduce the amount of padding to
    apply to batches during training. It offers several parameters to control where to
    split depending on the desired outcome, e.g. reduce padding or keep the largest
    amount of data at the cost of padding.

    This method will estimate the number of tokens for each bar depending on the
    tokenizer's average number of tokens per note (tpn), will loop over the estimated
    number of tokens per bar to determine the bars at which the file will be "cut".

    It is recommended to use this method with a non-zero ``num_overlap_bars``, as
    overlapping allows to keep a form of causality throughout a file from one chunk to
    another. It also reduces padding, but will slightly increase the overall training
    time.

    :param score: ``symusic.Score`` to split.
    :param max_seq_len: maximum number of tokens per sequence.

        this tokenizer.

        end at the bar *n* and start at the bar *n-1* respectively, thus they will
        encompass the same bar. This allows to create a causality chain between chunks.
        This value should be determined based on the ``average_num_tokens_per_note``
        value of the tokenizer and the ``max_seq_len`` value, so that it is neither
        too high nor too low. (default: ``1``).
